/**
 * ! Tree 
 * * it's a non-linear Data Structure
 * * conncted by nodes edges
 * * Hirerarchial Relationships between elements.
 * ? eg:- family tree, file directory system, organizational chart.
 * 
 * ! Features of Tree
 * 
 * * Root Node:
 * ? The topmost Node of a tree
 * ? Only one root in a Node tree
 * 
 * * Parant and Child Nodes:
 * ? The Node directly connected to a above called it's called parent.
 * ? Node directly connected below nodes that's are children
 * 
 * * Edge:
 * ? A connection between two nodes in the tree
 * 
 * * Leaf Node:
 * ? A node that has no children
 * 
 * * Subtree:
 * ? Any node along with its descendats forms a subtree
 * 
 * * Height of Tree:
 * ? The length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf.
 * 
 * * Depth of a Node:
 * ? The number of edges from the root node to the node.
 * 
 * * Binary Tree:
 * ? Each node has at most two children.
 * ? referred to as the left child and right child.
 * 
 * ! Application of Tree:-
 * 
 * * Binary Search Tree(Used for Searching and sorting data efficiently.)
 * * File System (Represent hierarchiel file structure.)
 * * Network Routing (Represent network hierarchies.)
 * * Tries (Used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings)
